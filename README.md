=============

Various git aliases and scripts I have found useful in everyday git use. Some of the scripts have been written by me, others (like git-wtf) have not.


Alias dependencies
------------------

Currently the only external dependency (besides the scripts in this repository) that some aliases refer to are some **git whistles** (https://github.com/mezis/git-whistles) commands.


Other recommended git extensions
